# European Funds Information Platform Server
This repository contains the server implementation for the European Funds Information Platform. The server is built using Python and Flask, and it facilitates communication between the frontend application and the OpenAI API for generating responses from the integrated chatbot.

**Features**

The European Funds Information Platform Server offers the following features:

API Communication: The server handles HTTP requests from the frontend application and forwards them to the OpenAI API for generating responses from the chatbot.

Chatbot Integration: The server receives user queries from the frontend and sends them to the OpenAI API. It then retrieves the generated responses and sends them back to the frontend for display.

Security Measures: The server implements necessary security measures, such as handling authentication and securely communicating with the OpenAI API, to protect user data and ensure confidentiality.

Error Handling: The server handles errors and exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages and logging the necessary information for debugging purposes.
